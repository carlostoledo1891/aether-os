## Project Overview

**Commercial brand: Vero** (from Latin *verus*, 'true'). Codebase retains `aether-os` as internal name. User-facing strings, copy, and pitch materials use Vero.

**Vero** is a B2B SaaS platform — the trust layer for critical mineral supply chains. Its flagship deployment is **Meteoric Resources' Caldeira Project** in Poços de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil (ASX: MEI).

The prototype is built to pitch to:
- **Buyers** (DoD, EV OEMs, magnet manufacturers) needing FEOC-clean, IRA-compliant supply
- **Regulators** (MPF, FEAM, IBAMA) needing real-time environmental compliance telemetry
- **Operators** (Meteoric Resources, Ucore, Neo Performance Materials) needing plant efficiency visibility
- **Executives** needing a pitch-ready financial / ESG overview

## How to Run

**Dev server:** `http://localhost:5175/` (frontend via Vite proxy → API at `:3001`)  
**Working directory:** `/Users/carlostoledo/Documents/Aether Project/aether-os`  
**Start all:** `npm run dev:all` (concurrently: API server + simulation engine + Vite frontend)  

**Marketing / deck copy (iterate in repo):** `docs/messaging-strategy.md` and `src/config/marketing.ts`

## Current Status & Sprint Focus

*   **Focus:** Perfect alignment between file hierarchy and canonical URL routing.
*   **Recent Changes:**
    - Reorganized `src/pages` into `marketing/`, `decks/`, and `views/` directories to match exact URL structures.
    - Cleaned up legacy route aliases in `src/App.tsx`.
    - Automatically patched relative imports across the entire deck slide hierarchy.
